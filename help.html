Asteroids is a two-dimensional space shooter game. You score points by destroying the asteroids. The aim of the game is to get the highest score.
<p/>
<p>
    You control your spaceship to avoid and eliminate the endless supply of asteroids that threaten to destroy it.
    You will start with 3 lives in a game and you will lose a life every time you crash into a asteroid. Once you destroy all the asteroids on the screen a new wave will begin with even more asteroids.
</p>
<p>
When you start the game, your spaceship will be in the middle of the screen. Heading toward your ship will be  3 large asteroids.Your job is to blast those rocks. However, when you blast them, they break up into 2 medium rocks.
Blasting a medium rock gives you 2 small rocks. These different sized rocks all have varied points for destroying them.
</p>
POINTS:
<table>
<tr><td>Object</td><td>	Points</td></tr>
<tr><td>Large Asteroids</td><td>10 points</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium Asteroids</td><td>50 points</td></tr>
<tr><td>Small Asteroids</td><td>100 points</td></tr>
</table>

In order to become a master of this game, you must be familiar with the buttons that control the ship. These are:

<ul>
<li>Left Rotation Button</li>
<li>Right Rotation Button</li>
<li>Fire Button</li>
<li>Thrust Button</li>
<li>Shield Button</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>To rotate right you press the right arrow key.</li>
<li>To rotate left you press the left arrow key.</li>
<li>To thrust the ship you press the forward arrow key. The more you hold it down the faster the ship will go but look out for those Asteroids.</li>

SHOOTING BULLETS:
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind a couple of things when shooting:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have 4 bullets on the screen at any one time. This is useful for when you are blasting rocks at close range.</li>
<li>Your bullets "wrap around" the screen. This means any bullet that goes past the edge of the screen will reappear on the
opposite side traveling the same direction.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
SHIELD:
<ul>
<li>When the game is started and when a next wave has began, the ship will have an activated shield around it to protect it from the asteroid.</li>
<li>This shield will be on the ship for 10 seconds, so quickly get away from those asteroids.</li>
<li>With this shield you will be able to hit a Asteroid and not lose a life.</li>
<li>This shield will be available to you when the shield box on the bottom left of the screen turns yellow.</li>
</ul>
